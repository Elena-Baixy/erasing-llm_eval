🚀 Launching Claude Code with Scribe notebook tools enabled...

I have completed the replication task for the ELM (Erasure of Language Memory) experiment. Here's a summary:

## Completed Tasks

1. **Explored Repository Structure**: Found and read `plan.md` and `CodeWalkthrough.md` which provided complete documentation of the ELM method.

2. **Reimplemented the Experiment**: Created a new notebook (`replication.ipynb`) that:
   - Implements the ELM edit vector computation formula
   - Implements the three-loss training framework (L_erase, L_retain, L_fluency)
   - Configures LoRA adapters on layers 4-7 with rank 256
   - Trains on Harry Potter erasure using Zephyr-7B base model
   - Demonstrates generation comparison between ELM and original model
   - Tests determinism with multiple runs

3. **Created Documentation Files**:
   - `documentation_replication.md` - Goal, Data, Method, Results, Analysis
   - `evaluation_replication.md` - Binary checklist evaluation with rationales
   - `self_replication_evaluation.json` - JSON summary

## Evaluation Results

| Criterion | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| RP1. Implementation Reconstructability | **PASS** |
| RP2. Environment Reproducibility | **PASS** |
| RP3. Determinism and Stability | **PASS** |

All outputs are saved in `/net/scratch2/smallyan/erasing-llm_eval/evaluation/replications/`.
