## Binary Checklist Results

| Checklist Item | Result |
|----------------|--------|
| **CS1: Conclusion vs Original Results** | **PASS** |
| **CS2: Implementation Follows the Plan** | **FAIL** |

### CS1 Rationale (PASS)
The inference.ipynb notebook contains no recorded outputs/results. The conclusions in plan.md reference external paper results (arXiv:2410.02760) rather than results recorded in this implementation. Since there are no recorded results to contradict, and the methodology implementation is consistent with the claims, CS1 passes.

### CS2 Rationale (FAIL)
Two plan steps are missing from the implementation:
1. **E3 - Adversarial attacks (GCG, BEAST)**: No implementation found in any Python file despite being specified in plan.md
2. **E4 - Internal representation analysis**: No probing accuracy or activation norm analysis code found

The core methodology (ELM with three loss terms, LoRA training, WMDP/HP erasure) is implemented, but the adversarial robustness testing and internal representation analysis experiments from the plan are not present in the codebase.
