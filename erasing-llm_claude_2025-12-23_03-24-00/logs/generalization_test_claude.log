The generalizability evaluation is complete. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Generalizability Evaluation Complete

### Output Files Created:
1. **`/net/scratch2/smallyan/erasing-llm_eval/evaluation/generalization_eval_summary.json`** - JSON summary with checklist results and rationales
2. **`/net/scratch2/smallyan/erasing-llm_eval/evaluation/generalization_eval.ipynb`** - Full evaluation notebook with code and analysis

### Results Summary:

| Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **GT1: Model Generalization** | **PASS** | ELM method applied to Phi-2 (not in original paper); LoRA on early layers works |
| **GT2: Data Generalization** | **PASS** | Novel biosecurity prompts (verified not in WMDP) show erasure behavior |
| **GT3: Method Generalization** | **PASS** | Drug synthesis erasure task demonstrates domain-agnostic applicability |

### Key Findings:
- The ELM method's core principle (early-layer modification with expert/novice guided generation) transfers effectively to new models
- Erasure behavior is not overfit to original training data - works on novel prompts
- The method generalizes to entirely new concept domains (drug synthesis vs. bioweapons/cybersecurity)
