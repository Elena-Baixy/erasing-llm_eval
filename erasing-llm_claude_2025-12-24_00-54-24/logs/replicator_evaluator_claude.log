The documentation evaluation has been completed. Here's the summary:

## Documentation Evaluation Results

**Final Verdict: REVISION REQUIRED**

| Criterion | Result | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| DE1. Result Fidelity | **FAIL** | Replication used reduced training (50 vs 3000-5000 iterations), did not compute same metrics (MMLU, HP-MCQ, R-PPL), and reported only "subtle" erasure vs. original's strong erasure claims |
| DE2. Conclusion Consistency | **PASS** | Conclusions about three-loss framework, early layers (4-7), and expert/novice prompting are consistent |
| DE3. No External Information | **PASS** | No hallucinated content; methodology accurately reflects original |

The replication successfully demonstrates the ELM methodology works but does not reproduce the claimed results at comparable scale. To achieve PASS status, the replication should run full-scale training and compute equivalent quantitative metrics.
