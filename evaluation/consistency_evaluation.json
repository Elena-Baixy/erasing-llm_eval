    "Checklist": {
        "CS1_Results_vs_Conclusion": "PASS",
        "CS2_Plan_vs_Implementation": "FAIL"
    },
    "Rationale": {
        "CS1_Results_vs_Conclusion": "The inference.ipynb notebook contains no recorded outputs/results. The conclusions in plan.md reference external paper results (arXiv:2410.02760) rather than results recorded in this implementation. Since there are no recorded results to contradict, and the methodology implementation is consistent with the claims, CS1 passes.",
        "CS2_Plan_vs_Implementation": "Two plan steps are missing implementation: (1) E3 - Adversarial attacks (GCG, BEAST): No implementation found in any Python file despite being specified in plan.md; (2) E4 - Internal representation analysis: No probing accuracy or detailed activation norm analysis code found. The plan specifies these experiments but they are not implemented in the codebase."
