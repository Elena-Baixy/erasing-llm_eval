  "Checklist": {
    "DE1_ResultFidelity": "FAIL",
    "DE2_ConclusionConsistency": "PASS",
    "DE3_NoExternalInformation": "PASS"
  },
  "Rationale": {
    "DE1_ResultFidelity": "The replicated documentation reports results that do not match the original within acceptable tolerance. The original documents strong erasure (38.3% HP-MCQ, near-random on WMDP) with maintained general capabilities, while the replication reports only 'subtle' erasure effects with 'Some Harry Potter knowledge persists.' The replication did not compute the same quantitative metrics (MMLU, HP-MCQ, R-PPL) and used reduced training scale (50 vs 3000-5000 iterations), making direct comparison impossible. While the replication is honest about its limitations, the results do not match.",
    "DE2_ConclusionConsistency": "The replicated documentation presents conclusions consistent with the original. Both agree on: (1) the three-loss framework is effective and crucial, (2) early layers (4-7) are effective targets, (3) expert/novice prompting works as designed. The replication honestly acknowledges its limitations (reduced training, no quantitative metrics) rather than making false claims. No conclusions contradict the original, and essential claims are preserved.",
    "DE3_NoExternalInformation": "No external or hallucinated information appears in the replicated documentation. The ELM formula, three-loss framework, LoRA configuration, and methodology all accurately reflect the original. Dataset substitutions (using publicly available Harry Potter and Wikipedia datasets) are transparent and reasonable. All claims reference the original methodology without introducing invented findings or external references."
