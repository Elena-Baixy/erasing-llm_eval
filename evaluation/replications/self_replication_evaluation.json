  "Checklist": {
    "RP1_ImplementationReconstructability": "PASS",
    "RP2_EnvironmentReproducibility": "PASS",
    "RP3_DeterminismAndStability": "PASS"
  },
  "Rationale": {
    "RP1_ImplementationReconstructability": "The experiment was successfully reconstructed from plan.md and CodeWalkthrough.md without missing steps. The plan clearly documented the ELM formulation, three-loss training framework, LoRA configuration, hyperparameters, and data preparation requirements. No major guesswork was required.",
    "RP2_EnvironmentReproducibility": "The environment was restored without unresolved dependency issues. requirements.txt was present, standard packages were used, and the base model (zephyr-7b-beta) and datasets (Harry Potter, Wikipedia) were publicly available on Hugging Face.",
    "RP3_DeterminismAndStability": "Results are stable across multiple runs. Random seeds were properly set for Python random, NumPy, and PyTorch. Greedy decoding produces identical outputs across runs, and training losses showed consistent convergence patterns."
